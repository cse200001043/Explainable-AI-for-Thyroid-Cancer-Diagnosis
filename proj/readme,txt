* Please make sure all the required packages are installed such as
  LIME,SHAP , skimage , PIL , numpy , pandas , copy


Before looking into code please look at internal working of lime and shap
otherwise its difficult to make sense

For interactive version to get sense of XAI models use project.ipynb file

Before running code please make all the path changes corresponding to your PC
Directory structure of my project :

I am attaching untouched version of matlab code (in thyroid folder)
and the stuff I changed in matlab (xai_thyroid folder) Please re run matlab code
to create matlab models

-project.ipynb
-custom_lime.py
-lime_lib.py
-shap.py
-ddti
-xai_thyroid
    - Data_temp :- where I put files to test for lime,shap
    - code
    - Data


And please make few optimizations if possible to make code run faster.
i) In test_with_single_input_7200_hot , features_of_single_image only return
  features of single image as we are having so many matlab func calls its taking time
  So please ensure if possible you are returning batch of images .

  similarly with return_probs_hog

file :- custom_lime.py
        My suggestion is to use project.ipynb to get sense of each step
        Functions : perturb_image
                        args :- image ,
                                a perturbation of an image ,
                                segments of image.
                        output :- return perturbed_image

                     For other segment of code I added comments
                     appropriately you can try various commented code by
                     uncommenting it to see the changes.
                     Novelity :- different segmentation techniques,
                                 Using custom locally weighted LR
                                 and its corresponding kernel function.

                    Drawback :- Takes time to run

        lime_lib.py
        library implementation of lime , code is self describable

        shap_lib_inpaint_telea.py
        shap implementation with inpaint_telea

        shap_lib_blur.py
        shap implementation with blur


Changes made in matlab code are self describable such as
test_with_single_input_7200_hot , features_of_single_image etc.. etc..
